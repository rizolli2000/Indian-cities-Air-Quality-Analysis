# Indian-cities-air-quality-analysis
This machine learning project uses clustering algorithms to analyze air quality data of various Indian cities. The goal is to group cities with similar air quality conditions and to identify any patterns or trends in the data. The data is pre-processed and then fed into the clustering algorithms, which are used to identify patterns in the data and generate clusters of cities with similar air quality characteristics. The results of the analysis are visualized and interpreted to gain insights into the air quality of different cities in India
